        <h3>The Short Story</h3>
        
        <p>Hi there, I'm Jordan and I'm a web developer. I love to expand my horizons, learn new skills and challenge myself. I am most experienced working with HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP and MySQL and I have been trying my hand with Node.js. I am capable of independent full stack development but I prefer to use my knowledge in a team environment. More brains are better than one but only if each brain can communicate with and understand the needs of the others. So instead of simply limiting myself to frontend or backend development exclusively, I learned both skill sets to maximize my potential and versatility.</p>
            
        <p>I also have a lot of experience with digital media and visual art; videography, animation, graphic design, Photoshop painting and photography. In what little spare time I have, I enjoy drawing. It's a hobby I've had for most of my life and it's something I've become very good at. You can view my work at <a href="http://art.jordanalamilla.com" target="_blank">The Artwork of Jordan Alamilla</a>. It's a simple gallery site I made to showcase my work. Don't hesitate to <a href="contact.php" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you wish to inquire about any of my work or purchase one of my original drawings.</p>
            
        <h3>The Long Story</h3>
        
        <h4>Seneca College</h4>
        
        <p>Approaching the conclusion of high school, I was faced with the reality of choosing a direction for my future. I've been drawing for most of my life and I became pretty good at it. I also enjoyed my time in the media arts class that my school offered so, lacking any other passions, I made the lukewarm decision to attend the, then known, Digital Media Arts (DMA) program at Seneca College. There I gained a wide range of experience in all forms of digital media; graphic design, 2D and 3D animation, video production, photography, print, sound engineering, web design, illustration and so on.</p>
        
        <h4>Graduation and Degradation</h4>
            
        <p>I graduated in 2013 receiving a diploma but due to a very prolonged and stressful ordeal that spanned the entirety of final semester, I exited bearing the burden of an immense existential crisis and numerous other mental health issues centered around my worth as a person and as an employee. Not only was I in no shape psychologically to start a career but I realized that this "wide range of skills" I had meant I had no expertise; I knew many things but I didn't know them well.</p>
        
        <h4>Zeiss</h4>
        
        <p>It was never official but I do believe that I went through what could qualify as a deep depression. But I have never been one to allow things like this to overcome me. My father works at Carl Zeiss Vision, managing a lab where prescription lenses for glasses are manufactured. He got me a job that summer to cover for employees that often went on vacations during this time of year. Essentially, my job changed every time someone else left on vacation. I was moved around and trained frequently and gradually developed a great work ethic and work flow and although I had many jobs, I was great at all of them and became known as a reliable, trustworthy and competent employee.</p>
        
        <h4>Rehabilitation</h4>
        
        <p>Throughout the following year, I slowly developed a foundation of small achievements and important life skills that I could use to rebuild myself mentally; there was now tangible evidence that could look at and prove to myself that I was worth something more than I had been thinking. With this new confidence and ability I made for myself along with having a useful amount of money for the first time in my life, I applied to the Computer Programmer (CPAN) program at Humber College.</p>
        
        <h4>A New Passion</h4>
        
        <p>During my recovery at Zeiss, I began to value rationality and objectivity much more. If these awful emotions come from subjective opinions then I must only concern myself with objective facts and things that can be proven. I believe this was where my sudden affinity for programming developed. Programming is absolute logic. There is no opinion that influences how code will run. It is either functional and written correctly or it isn't; true or false; 1 or 0.</p>
        
        <h4>Humber College</h4>
        
        <p>In the fall of 2014, I started computer programming at Humber. The main language we focused on was Java. I was introduced to and quickly became familiar with the concepts of object oriented programming. Throughtout the 2 year program, I was also exposed to C#, ASP.NET, Python, the web development stack, PHP, MySQL and database administration. I fell in love with programming and the thought of doing this for a living was amazing to me. But even though I found what I loved, it still felt like it was missing something. Being in an eminently rational and cold calculating profession felt bleak at times. My original love for visual art and design and creativity wasn't being satisfied; I had gone too far in the other direction.</p>
        
        <h4>Still Not There</h4>
        
        <p>After graduating from Humber with my second diploma, I went back to Zeiss, telling myself that I just needed to work on a portfolio and I'll have a real job in 4 months. But with my history of being a top employee, I was eventually given a full time static position, being told that I could be released once they find someone to replace me. I ended up staying there for almost another year. It was somewhat of a tough situation I was in. I wanted to leave this job and get my programming career going but at the same time, I needed money and I honestly wasn't sure if I knew enough to succeed. It was very much the same problem I had after Seneca; I had a lot of exposure but no expertise. This is what kept me working at Zeiss for so long which, even more, meant the longer I was there, the more knowledge I was losing.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually I had enough and the idea of being stuck at Zeiss for the rest of my life was eating at me. They finally hired a replacement, so I applied to Humber again, this time to the Web Design and Development (WDDM) program. I trained my replacement and a few backups and as soon as I found out I was accepted, I finally quit.</p>
        
        <h4>The Beauty of Web Development: My Humber Application Cover Letter</h4>
        
        <p>My second application to Humber required me to submit a resume and a cover letter. I found this a little intimidating because of my lack of real world experience and how long it's been since I wrote any code. So I just held my anxiety down and wrote what I felt:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            
            <p>&ldquo;To whom it may concern,</p>
            
            <p>I have always had a passion for making things. The feeling of converting a simple, intangible idea into a real life thing that I can see with my own eyes is infinitely valuable to me. Iâ€™ve been drawing for as long as I can remember and only within the past five years have been looking to develop my eye for detail and desire for structure into something that I can use to benefit others, if not in a business sense, then purely for a viewing pleasure or to inspire thought. I learned to work with digital graphics so I can have a real world application for my skill with traditional art and I learned to program simply to have a more structured and definable skill to compliment, if not found my creativity on top of.</p>
            
            <p>Admittedly, while I am capable, I do not believe that I am proficient with my skills in digital art or programming because I have spent the better part of the past five years trying to gain as much exposure to as many aspects of both of these realms as possible. Object oriented programming, web development, graphic design, video, sound, photography, all things I have experience with but none of which, I truly master. I now feel like I have seen enough and have chosen a specific facet of the industry to specialize in. I wish to finally focus my attention on what I have deemed to be the ultimate unification of the freedom of art and the structure of programming, which is, web design and development.&rdquo;</p>
            
        </blockquote>
        
        <h4>Humber College: Part 2</h4>
        
        <p>In the fall of 2017, I started the 22 week certificate program for Web Design and Development. With a class that started with 10 students and gradually widdled down to 4, under the guidance of Thomas Borzecki, Mark-Anthony Karam and Benjamin Block, I received the most comprehensive, thorough and efficient education I've ever experienced. Now working within the boundaries of "web development", I was now developing the more focused set of skills and expertise that I didn't get in my previous 2 programs. I became proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL. On top of that, I learned more practical things like web hosting services, deploying a website, mobile design, image optimization, Git and Wordpress. I also got a bit of experience working with API's, the HTML Canvas and WebGL.</p>
        
        <h4>Hello World</h4>
        
        <p>And now, the present day. I completed WDDM on February 23, 2018, finally feeling satisfied both with myself as a well rounded adult and with my abilities as a web developer. I have faced and overcome enough adversity in my life and enough obstacles in my code to know that I can deal with pretty much anything. All it takes is honesty, an open mind and a desire to learn. I no longer have any qualms with convincing someone to hire me because I finally know that I know what I'm doing.</p>
